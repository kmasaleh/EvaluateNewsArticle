## Introduction
This project "Evaluate News Article using NLP" is static single page site that asigned to me as an assessment from UDACITY, the mission was to implement this site production using Webpack and javascript code and applying code testing methodology.

## Vision
My vision was to utilize and apply OOP concepts and async programming  that I learned to  implement the needed functionality using  ES6 javascript classes that construct the model of the page by wrapping its elements inside a few well connected functions that do the job.

## Finishing
After finsiging coding I'd implmented some testing functionality to the site using Jest and make sure of the working features I made.
